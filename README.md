# COVID19-Delta-Variant-Detector-
Identified the most common genetic probe sequence in Delta variant's genetic sequences using Used Rabinâ€“Karp algorithm (rolling hash function) to reduce running time from 10 minutes to 5 seconds, then  used that genetic probe to differentiate the Delta variant of Covid-19 from other variants by comparing hash values of the sequences
